This package offers a set of functions to use in order to compute 
communities on graphs weighted or unweighted. A typical sequence of 
actions is:

1. Conversion from a text format (each line contains a couple "src dest")
./convert -i graph.txt -o graph.bin
This program can also be used to convert weighted graphs (each line contain
a triple "src dest w") using -w option:
./convert -i graph.txt -o graph.bin -w graph.weights
Finally, nodes can be renumbered from 0 to nb_nodes-1 using -r option
